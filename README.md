# KeyValueStore.Forks
Fork your KV store's data with minimal memory footprint.
We try to make it as performant as possible considering some performance is the tradeoff for the low memory footprint when working on 2 forks of the same data when data is changed over time.

# Usage
Using the console tool - create app, choose your key value store implementation (Currently only redis is implemented, but it is easy to implement more wrappers for other engines), create a FroksWrapper with a forkId and start using the wrapper as your data source.

# Completed features
* StackExchange.Redis wrapper implemetation for Set/Get with String/Hash data types
* Set/Get ForkWrapper based on forks, currently a parent fork is Readonly while leaf forks are not.

# Missing first version features
* Delete - apis
* Areas
* ForkWrapper
  * Fork provider + Grace period, timestamp outside the fork, locking while replacing
* Fork Management (apis)
  * Create app - creates master fork. (Use ZeroFormatter)
  * Create (fork, not maser)-  (Use ZeroFormatter)
  * Grace period (With adding forks)
  * Delete - only when no children, flush all keys
  * Merge - only update keys, the target mustnâ€™t have children
    * Merge by area
  * Prune old forks
  * Select forks
  * Set readonly (part of create too)
* Console Tool

# Future features
* Allow working on parent fork (Complex Locking in redis).
* Delete when children exist (Merge keys from deleted fork into children)
* ForkStatusEnum (Controlling when a fork is available for different uses - will replace Readonly flag)
